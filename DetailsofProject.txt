Details about the project :

I have referred to the user story : User should be able to register using a valid email address

The BDD file of the same user story has been created as BDD.txt

The automation framework has various classes and an excel file, the details of which are below:

1)Excel File - This file will act as an input and contains the Keywords and Arguments which have to be given by the user.

2)TestDriverClass - Contains the main function and the function to read test case from the EXCEL File.

3)TestExcelDriver - contains all the excel function to read from the excel file and getting the row counts.

4)TestCommonDriver - contains function to open chrome/firefox, navigate to URL and Sign into the website.

5)TestKeywords - Contains function to recognise keywords and action accordingly by calling the suitable function.

6) TestUtils  - Contains  function to recognise various  locators- currently this is not being called in our example as we have not given any input for the locator field.
